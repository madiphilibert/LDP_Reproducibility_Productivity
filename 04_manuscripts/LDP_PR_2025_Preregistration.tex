\subsection{The relationship of paternal gut microbiome and hormone

lemurs}\label{the-relationship-of-paternal-gut-microbiome-and-hormone-profiles-on-the-degree-of-infant-care-in-red-bellied-lemurs}

\section{Design Plan}\label{design-plan}

\subsection{Study type}\label{study-type}

\textbf{Experiment}. A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study
subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as
an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.

\textbf{Observational Study}. Data is collected from study subjects that
are not randomly assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, natural
experiments, and regression discontinuity designs.

\textbf{Meta-Analysis}. A systematic review of published studies.

\textbf{Other}. Please explain.

\subsection{Blinding}\label{blinding}

No blinding is involved in this study.

For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the
treatment group to which they have been assigned.

Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or
non-human subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments.

Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of
the treatment applied to any given group.

\section{Sampling Plan}\label{sampling-plan}

\subsection{Existing data}\label{existing-data}

\textbf{Registration prior to creation of data}. As of the date of
submission of this research plan for preregistration, the data have not
yet been collected, created, or realized.

\textbf{Registration prior to any human observation of the data}. As of
the date of submission, the data exist but have not yet been quantified,
constructed, observed, or reported by anyone - including individuals
that are not associated with the proposed study. Examples include museum
specimens that have not been measured and data that have been collected
by non-human collectors and are inaccessible.

\textbf{Registration prior to accessing the data}. As of the date of
submission, the data exist, but have not been accessed by you or your
collaborators. Commonly, this includes data that has been collected by
another researcher or institution.

\textbf{Registration prior to analysis of the data}. As of the date of
submission, the data exist and you have accessed it, though no analysis
has been conducted related to the research plan (including calculation
of summary statistics). A common situation for this scenario when a
large dataset exists that is used for many different studies over time,
or when a data set is randomly split into a sample for exploratory
analyses, and the other section of data is reserved for later
confirmatory data analysis.

\textbf{Registration following analysis of the data}. As of the date of
submission, you have accessed and analyzed some of the data relevant to
the research plan. This includes preliminary analysis of variables,
calculation of descriptive statistics, and observation of data
distributions. Please see \url{https://cos.io/prereg} for more
information.
